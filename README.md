- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- React - For building the UI
- React Icons - For social media icons

What I Learned:
This project reinforced key skills, such as component-based design and responsive styling in React. The dynamic mapping of social links allowed for efficient rendering and scalability. Below is a key snippet that demonstrates this approach:

js
<div className="social_links">
  {socials.map((link) => (
    <a
      key={link.id}
      href={link.url}
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      {link.icon}
      {link.name}
    </a>
  ))}
</div>

Continued Development
Future enhancements could include:
- Adding animations to the hover effects for smoother transitions.
- Integrating additional information or skills relevant to the author.
- Incorporating accessibility features to improve usability for all users.
- Useful Resources
- React Icons - Helpful for adding social media icons.
